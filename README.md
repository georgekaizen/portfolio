## How to Deploy Changes to GitHub Pages

Whenever you make changes to the portfolio, follow these simple steps to deploy to your live site:

### Step 1: Save and Stage Your Changes
```bash
git add .
```

### Step 2: Commit Your Changes
```bash
git commit -m "Your commit message describing the changes"
```

### Step 3: Push to GitHub (Main Branch)
```bash
git push origin main
```

### Step 4: Build and Deploy to GitHub Pages
```bash
npm run deploy
```

This will automatically:
- Build your React app for production
- Deploy the built files to the gh-pages branch
- Your changes will be live at https://georgekaizen.github.io/portfolio in 1-2 minutes

### Quick Deploy (All Steps Combined)
```bash
git add . && git commit -m "Update portfolio" && git push origin main && npm run deploy
```
